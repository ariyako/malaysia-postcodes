# Malaysia Postcode List
A list of postcode in Malaysia, with fields tags for Peninsular (West Malaysia), Klang Valley in multiple formats.

## About the Coordinates
While an area within a postcode should be marked with a proper polyline set in KML format and such, these postcodes 
were marked with the central point of the area instead. While some might not agree that this represents an inaccurate
representation of the geo data type for the postcodes, it is provided if in case you are presented with a scenario that
you needed an *estimation* of how far you are from a certain postcode. I would suggest using Haversine formula to calculate these distances.

Coordinates were included were stored using MySQL Spatial Extensions, in POINT(lat,lon) format.
